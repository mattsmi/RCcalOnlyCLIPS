#Finding a Date for a Solemnity when it coincides with a Higher Feast
According to Chapter I, n. 5 of the *Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar*, if a Solemnity falls on a Sunday of Advent, Lent, or Easter (or by extension on Ash Wednesday, within Holy Week or within Easter Week), are transferred to the following Monday.
    
##Special handling for the feast of St Joseph.
   According to *The Roman Missal*, third typical edition, n. 56, St Joseph's feast is moved to the Saturday before Palm Sunday, if it falls on Palm Sunday. If not a holy day of obligation, the local bishops conference may move it to any date outside of Lent.

However, The following is a basic translation of information published in *Notitiae* (42:3–4) by the Congregation for Divine Worship.
>The attention of Congregation for Divine Worship has been brought to the occurrence of some celebrations in 2008.
>In particular St Joseph (19 March) falls on Wednesday of Holy Week and the Annunciation (25 March) falls on Tuesday of Easter Week.
>According to the Norms found in GNLY it is necessary to transfer the celebrations in this way:
+ ‘Where the Solemnity of St Joseph is a Holyday of Obligation and if it falls on 6th Sunday of Lent, it is celebrated on 18 March. 
+ Where it is not a day of Obligation Bishops’ Conferences may transfer it outside Lent’ (56.f) 
+ ‘The Annunciation when it falls in Holy Week is transferred to first available day after 2nd Sunday of Easter.’ (60)
+ Therefore in 2008 St Joseph will be celebrated on 15 March, the Saturday before Palm Sunday;
+ the Annunciation will be celebrated on 31 March — the Monday after 2nd Sunday of Easter.

##St Patrick, when it is a solemnity
#For St Patrick, Universalis notes the following here: http://universalis.wordpress.com/category/calendars/ .
There is a further complication in Ireland and other places where St Patrick is celebrated as a solemnity.
In these places, when there is an earlier Easter, St Patrick is moved earlier to avoid Holy Week, and St Joseph is moved one day earlier still, to the Friday before Holy Week.

#Saturday Memoria of the Blessed Virgin Mary
"On Saturdays in Ordinary Time when no Obligatory Memorial occurs, an Optional Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary may be celebrated" \(*Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and Calendar*, n. 15\).

#Cycle of Readings at Mass
##Gospel readings
>Each of the years is designated by the letter A, B, or C. The following is the procedure to determine which year is A, B, or C. The letter C designates a year whose number is divisible into three equal parts, as though the cycle had taken its beginning from the first year of the Christian era. Thus the year 1 would have been Year A; year 2, Year B; year 3, Year C \(as would years 6, 9, and 12\). Thus, for example, year 1980 is Year C; 1981, Year A; 1982, Year B; and 1983, Year C again. And so forth. Obviously each cycle runs in accord with the plan of the liturgical year, that is, it begins with the First Week of Advent, which falls in the preceding year of the civil calendar. The year in each cycle is marked in a sense by the principal characteristic of the Synoptic Gospel used for the semicontinuous reading of Ordinary Time. Thus the first Year of the cycle is the Year for the reading of the Gospel of Matthew and is so named; the second and third Years are the Year of Mark and the Year of Luke.

##Weekday Readings at Mass
>For the thirty-four weeks of Ordinary Time, the weekday Gospel readings are arranged in a single cycle, repeated each year. But the first reading is arranged in a two-year cycle and is thus read every other year. Year I is used during odd-numbered years; Year II, during even-numbered years.
